                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify the online color converter you used to complete this assignment. Include an absolute link to your resource and include the target attribute to open the page in a new tab. -->

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p>HSL is a more recent and spontaneous way to work with colors. Unlike in Hex and RGBA, where you have to meddle with some numbers to get the color you want, in HSL, we can define the color using the Hue and play with the second and third parameter percentages to get the saturation and lightness levels you need. </p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p>Preferred color code format: I like RGB because it is very easy and simple to type in</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p>HWB summary HWB is a cylindrical-coordinate representation of points in an RGB color model, similar to HSL and HSV. It was developed by HSVâ€™s creator Alvy Ray Smith in 1996 to address some of the issues with HSV. HWB was designed to be more intuitive for humans to use and slightly faster to compute.</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p>CMYK summary The CMYK color model is a subtractive color model, based on the CMY color model, used in color printing, and is also used to describe the printing process itself. The abbreviation CMYK refers to the four ink plates used: cyan, magenta, yellow, and key</p>
